# HOMEWORK 1
  
  For your first homework you are responsible for adding "add-task" functionality for our
  to do list application. When "Add-Task" button is pressed with an input, the written input-text
  should be added to our list items.
  
  ## Requirements: 
  
  - Style of this application will "NOT" be considered for homework-1. (you can use default styles)
  
  - When add-task button is pressed with an input value, it should be added to the list.
  
  - When input field is empty 'add-task' button should 'NOT' add any item to the list.
  
  
  ## Hints: 
  
    Just look the comments that i've added to our code-base and when you follow the hints your homework will be done :)
    You don't need to copy paste any code from anywhere, just follow the hints and remember the flow that we make on 
    our lesson. 
    Just be sure any cheating will be detected and will not be tolarated...
